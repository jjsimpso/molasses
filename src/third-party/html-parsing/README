This is a local copy of the html-parsing package by Neil Van Dyke. It
is licensed under LGPLv3. See official site at:

http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket/html-parsing/.

This copy is branched from version 11:0 and has been modified to
better support 1990s html. These changes could potentially cause
problems with modern HTML. Once development stabilizes, the plan is to
see if these changes can be accepted into the official package.
