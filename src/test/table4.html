Well, dear fellow crackers, reversers and protectors (and readers), I'm sure you'll 
enjoy the 1998 'shift': no more 'blind' cracking around. We need good 
and powerful doucuments not only to 
reverse the hell out of it... but to understand what we are doing as well!<bR>In fact: what is the <u>purpose</u> of our work?
Why do we crack? Did you ever stop and asked yourself such questions?<bR>I believe 
that we crack in order to spread KNOWLEDGE!... I believe that we crack in order to 
SURVIVE (in a society where all what you should know is NOT teached and all what you 
do not need to know is hammered inside your brain :-)<br>I believe that we tackle difficoult 
tasks and that we reverse code (and other things as well :-), in order to TEACH! Show me
other sites on the web, apart from crackers' and (to a certain extent) hackers' sites, 
that give you knowledge like this for FREE, without asking anything more than your 
(free) contribution... LEARN ALL WHAT YOU CAN and give us in return THAT WHAT YOU CAN... 
a very simple "magic" recipe for development... on this web of ours.<bR>Indeed I believe that we want people to 
develop, to gain power and knowledge to build on our shoulders for free... the more, the better<bR>So we'll NEVER just 
spread around some ready-made cracks (why should we?), on the contrary: we will 
less and less publish 'cracks' and more and more concentrate on HOW TO DO things... therefore
 a "HCU papers" section will be very important for REAL crackers and reversers, and 
wont help leechers and lusers... that's nice! In fact, let's utter it: we DO NOT LIKE leechers and 
lusers... and we (firmly) believe that only people that DO contribute have a right to learn 
and grow and develop... that's why we will ALWAYS be able to develop
      ourselves... :-)</i></td></tr></table>
